The default keyboard short cut can be found by:
-> Help "close tab"
-> direct to File "Close Tab" cmd + W
HOWEVER, I set cms + W is shortcut for screen shots
So, instead, we can redefine the close tab shortcut in our mac system
-> Keyboard
-> Shortcuts
-> Move to the application
-> select app "Safri" 
-> enter the menu name "Close Tab" (exactly same name Cap)
-> cmd + D

The other shortcut for open new tab is cmd + T
